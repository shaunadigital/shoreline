# Shoreline: project status

Last updated 2026-10-26.

## What it is

A browser driving game and portfolio piece: drive a little coral off-roader around a tropical island, knock things over, play mini games. Inspired by the feel of Bruno Simon's portfolio (bruno-simon.com), with Shauna's own tropical look, vehicle and art. For fun, not commercial.

- Live: https://games.shauna.digital/shoreline/ (also https://shoreline-psi.vercel.app)
- Repo: https://github.com/shaunadigital/shoreline (public, branch `main`)
- Vercel project `shoreline` (team `shaunagits-projects`). Deploys go through the Vercel MCP `create_deployment` with `gitSource` pointing at the repo, then check the live bundle hash. The hub (repo `shaunagits/games`) mounts it at `/shoreline/` with one redirect and two rewrites in its `vercel.json`, and shows a Shoreline card (first, with the New sticker).
- Who does what: Shauna makes all the art (concept images, then 3D in Blender, exported as .glb). Claude does code, integration, layout and deploys. Asset prompts and the pipeline are in `_docs/ASSET_PROMPTS.md`.

## Live now (the new island, built 2026-10-26)

- **Island** from `src/island-plan.json`: flat ground, sandy beaches, nine pools with sandy banks and water you can splash into (tow back to the landing), gentle bumps on open grass only. The Oahu terrain and its data are gone.
- **Race circuit**: asphalt with red and white curbs, dashed center line, checkered start line under the race arch, and the short raised, banked turn at the kink on the top straight (about 1.9 high, tilted up on the outside, teal and white rails so you stay on). Lap race: crossing the start line starts the clock, 7 checkpoints around the loop (a glowing strip and a floating marker show the next one), crossing the line again records the lap and starts the next one. A steady test lap takes about 30 s.
- **Sand paths** between the zones, and a wooden bridge (pier sections) where the landing path crosses the south pond.
- **Zones**: Landing (spawn, SHORELINE letters, welcome and Shell Hunt signs, beach balls), Race circuit, Jump yard (four ramps, crate stack, dynamite), Tiki village (hut you can drive through, bowling lane and torches, fruit cart, firework barrel), Sports park (soccer field and goals, mini golf), Beach front (pier, umbrella and chairs, surf rack, coconut bombs), Lighthouse point (lighthouse, rocks), Treasure crater (small rim to climb, chest that spills gold doubloons). Each zone has a wooden sign.
- **Nature**: 110 swaying palms along the beaches and pool shores, about 100 flowering trees (poinciana, jacaranda, plumeria, golden shower) inland with their leafy tops swaying, 90 hibiscus and monstera bushes you can drive through (they shake), 18,000 tufts of instanced grass blowing in the wind (9,000 on small screens).
- **Boat** sails the `boatLoop` circle around the island.
- Off-roader, mini games, best scores in localStorage (`shoreline.bowling`, `.shells`, `.goals`, `.golf`, and `.circuit` for the lap; the old `.race` key held tiki gate times and is no longer read), effects and touch controls as before.

## Decided

| Date | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 2026-10 | Name "Shoreline". Off-roader, no Jeep-style grille. Public repo. Lives at games.shauna.digital/shoreline. |
| 2026-10-25 | Driving feel is good for now. |
| 2026-10-25 | Replace the Oahu island with a new, flat, designed island. No mountains. No paintable map. |
| 2026-10-25 | **Island plan draft 2 approved, with changes**: `src/island-plan.json`, drawn in `art/island-plan.png`. The circuit copies the general serpentine shape of the reference map's track (mirrored to the east and north side) and the pools copy the reference's pool layout. Nothing else is copied. Changes asked for: add a short raised, banked turn on the top straight (at the small kink near the middle of the north edge), and keep the sports park where draft 2 shows it (open grass between the start straight and the south loop pond). |
| 2026-10-25 | Sound waits until the new island is built. Music: find different CC0 tropical tracks, not the reference site's. |
| 2026-10-25 | "Ask the Tiki" (a Claude-powered chat character): not now, maybe later. It would need a small server with rate limits. |
| 2026-10-26 | Built the island as planned, with three small fits found while building: the south pond is cut back where it ran under the start straight, the coast is pushed out a little under the east straight, and the tightest corners (the kink and the south-west hairpin) are eased slightly so the inside curbs never fold. The banked turn reaches out over the surf on purpose. |
| 2026-10-26 | Bushes have no collider (you drive through and they shake); trees have trunk colliders. |
| 2026-10-26 | The gold doubloon model is the treasure coin that spills from the chest (assumed; Shauna to confirm). |

## Next

- Shauna drives the new island and lists anything to move or tune (zone positions are in `src/layout.js`, the shapes in `src/island-plan.json`).
- Sound effects and CC0 music (not the reference site's).
- Achievements and reasons to keep playing (a list of goals across the mini games, saved in localStorage, shown in a small panel).

## Known notes

- Headless Chromium (swiftshader) is slow, so tests drive the game with `simulate()` rather than real time. `tools/checks/play.mjs` serves `dist/`, runs steps passed in the `STEPS` env var (JSON list of `{name, js, shot}`) and saves screenshots; it needs the globally installed Playwright (`NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g)`). `window.__shoreline.debug.holdCamera = true` stops the follow camera so a check can place it.
- Moving a prop: change `src/layout.js`, then `node tools/checks/run.mjs layout-check` prints each prop's distance to water, the circuit edge and the paths.
- Startup builds distance grids for the whole island (about 0.4 s on a laptop).
- Vercel builds one project at a time for this account; a stuck build elsewhere (for example faf-app) blocks deploys here.
- Right after a deploy, the live site can serve the old bundle for a minute. Retry once the bundle hash matches.
- Every Blender export includes all scenes in the .blend: always run `tools/glb-clean.mjs`.
